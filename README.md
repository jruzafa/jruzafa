# Hello, I' am Jose Ruzafa ðŸ‘‹

I am senior backend developer, i have 9 years of experience
in development, since 2020 I work with DDD (hexagonal architecture), testing, SOLID principles,
CQRS, software design patterns and event-driven architecture, with concern in the continuous
improvement of a cleaner and more robust code, always using the correct tool for the problem
to be solved.
